# Graph Search Algorithms
Graph search algorithms traverse through the graph in search of objectives or solutions defined by the user. The end result could be a table of solutions, path traversed to reach an objective or even a simple yes or no. In this package, 4 basic graph search algorithms will be elaborated with others being an extention of these 4 basic graph search algorithms. 

1. `bfs` (Breath First Search) - An algorithm which traverses an **unweighted graph** layer by layer from the **shallowest to the deepest** layer.
2. `dfs` (Depth First Search) -  An algorithm which tries to explore the deepest nodes of an **unweighted graph** as quickly as possible.
3. `djikstra` (Djikstra's Algorithm) - Shortest simple path algorithm for **weighted graphs** with only **non negative edges**.
4. `bellman_ford` (Bellman-Ford Algorithm) - A more general shortest simple path algorithms for all **weighted-graphs**. In the presenece of a **negative cycle**, the Bellman-Ford Algorithm will detect the cycle but becomes incapable of finding shortest (simple) path.
