# Heap

A heap is a data structure which maintains a set of elements in a way such that the element having **maximum/minimum** key can be easily obtained. Elements can also be added or removed from this data structure at fast speeds while maintaining the above property. This property is known as the ***Max/Min-Heap*** property. The heap implemented in our case is a <u>Max-Heap</u>.

# Heap operations summary

The following table contains the operatations frequently used in a Heap data structure.

|Operation|Description|Time Complexity|
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
`insert(key)`| Inserts *key* into the data structure while maintaining the max-heap property|
